                &emsp; <strong>March 8th... ...Graduation.</strong> What do you want to do after this? Let's go to that place. I... Saki Yoshida, after spending three years at middle school, graduated... Without making a single friend... <i>*Sigh*</i> How did it end up like this...? ............ I want to change... I'm going home... A person that's a part of... This fun, bright world... I want to become one.

               &emsp; <i>Mom~ I'm home~</i> Oh, welcome home, Saki~ Did you eat lunch? You had your graduation ceremony today , right?  How was it? Mom...  C-can you teach me how to do makeup?  ...You can apply it more naturally if you do it like this. Makeup's not allowed at the school you're going to, but... I'm sure just using lipgloss is fine, right? Mm ...Like this? Yep. That's it. Oh, i know! Do you want to go to the beautysalon with your mom right now? Huh? Beauty... It'll be better if you got 
                a pro to cut your hair! They can also teach you how to set up your hair properly too! With just a few words. My mother, whi I haven't talked to in a while, became happy. Fufufu~ I wonder how long it's been since we last went out together. Honey~! What do you think? Doesn't Saki look beautiful? <strong>M-MOM! STOP IT!</strong> All this time, I looked down on people who obsessed over their appearance, but after I started caring about it just a little my self... Y-yes... Y-... you look beautiful... Saki... I got my stern father to give me an embarrassed smile. ...Thanks. ...I was happy.

                to look like a normal person? <i>Uuu...</i> Did I mess up...? Is it impossible for me? Be care on your way home all ofyou. Um... Yoshida-san! Would you like to walk home with us? There's a really nice juice place nearby... Huh...? ...Yoshida-san? Huh...? Oh... Yeah... I do... Isn't this what you call hanging out with your friends...? See ya later, Yoshida-san! See you Sunday!
